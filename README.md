# Custom React TypeScript Boilerplate

This is a custom React TypeScript boilerplate built from scratch to learn the underlying concepts and setup of a typical React project with TypeScript. 
It provides a basic configuration for starting a React application, including webpack configuration, TypeScript setup, Jest for testing, ESLint for code linting, 
Prettier for code formatting, and a sample component. 

## Features

- **Webpack**: Bundles and builds the React application.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript for improved code quality and maintainability.
- **ESLint**: Provides linting rules for maintaining code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: Code formatter for consistent code style.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for unit testing React components.
- **Example Component**: A simple example component to get started.
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing for single-page applications. (dev branch)

## Getting Started

To use this boilerplate, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/reenanfs/react-ts-boilerplate-from-scratch.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-ts-boilerplate-from-scratch`

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies using npm or Yarn:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

3. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080 to see the example component.

## Testing

You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
or

```bash
yarn test
```

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of your React application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```
or

```bash
yarn build
```
This will generate a build folder containing optimized and minified assets for deployment.

> **Notice:** This custom React TypeScript boilerplate is intended for learning purposes and getting familiar with the underlying concepts and setup of a typical React project with TypeScript. 
While it provides a configuration for starting a React application, it is recommended to use battle-tested tools like Create React App (CRA) or Vite for production environments.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this boilerplate to fit your specific needs. You can add additional dependencies, configure webpack plugins, modify the testing setup, or modify the folder structure based on your project requirements.
